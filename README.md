## R code
* **Figures.R** contains code to regenerate the figures
* **Model_Parameters.R** contains code for specifying parameters of the model
* **Model_EstimateBeta.R** contains code for estimating beta according to the specified R0
* **Model_SampleNext.R** contains code for sampling the next state and time to the next state
* **Model_Main.R** contains code for the individual-based model
* * **Simulation_best_worst_scenarios_with_sens.R** contains code for running the simulations under the best- and worst-case intervention scenarios for China as an example. Simulations for other places can be simply adapted from this file by changing the input file for the parameter sets, age structure and vaccine coverage. Results generated by this file were used to make Figure 2 in the manuscript.
* **Simulation_Random100.R** contains example code for running the simulations for China with the 100 sets of intervention parameters randomly sampled by the Latin hypercube sampling method from the full parameter space. Simulations for other places and for the reduced parameter space can be simply adapted from this file by changing the input file for the parameter sets, age structure and vaccine coverage
* **Save_model_for_shiny.R** contains code for saving the GP models fitted in the reduced intervention parameter space
